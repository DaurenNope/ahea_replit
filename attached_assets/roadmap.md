**Key Considerations & Decisions Throughout:**

*   **App Router vs. Pages Router:** App Router is the future for Next.js. If starting new, strongly consider it.
*   **Styling Solution:** Make a firm decision early (Tailwind, CSS Modules, etc.) for consistency.
*   **CMS Selection:** This is critical. Choose based on budget, technical expertise for maintenance, content editor experience, and scalability.
*   **Content Availability:** Content creation/migration is a major task. Coordinate closely with AHEU content team. (!This can be a bottleneck).
*   **Third-Party Integrations:** Identify any required integrations early (e.g., application portal, payment gateways, CRM).
*   **Team Communication & Version Control:** Regular stand-ups, clear task management (e.g., Jira, Trello), and disciplined Git workflow.
*   **Scope Management:** Stick to the defined MVP for Phase 1 to avoid delays. Enhancements can come later.

This roadmap is a comprehensive guide. Adjust timelines and priorities based on your team's size, experience, and the availability of content and decisions from AHEU stakeholders. Good luck!


How to use this in VSCode:

Create a new file named ROADMAP.md in the root of your Next.js project.

Copy the entire content above and paste it into ROADMAP.md.

VSCode has excellent Markdown preview capabilities. You can open the preview (Ctrl+Shift+V or Cmd+Shift+V) to see it rendered nicely.

As you complete tasks, you can change [ ] to [x].

This provides a strong, actionable base for your project. Remember to adapt it as the project evolves and new requirements or challenges arise.
